# pigweb client

This was initially generated from the [eframe template](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template). Here, we use the following dependencies:

- **[eframe/egui](https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/tree/main) for GUI.** Obeying the DOM and supporting web
  browser accessibility features are not a priority with the limited userbase this app is designed for, learning how to
  code in Rust and egui is more important.
- **[ehttp](https://github.com/emilk/ehttp?tab=readme-ov-file) for HTTP requests to the server.** Keep an eye
  on [emilk/ehttp#18](https://github.com/emilk/ehttp/issues/18)
  and [emilk/ehttp#62](https://github.com/emilk/ehttp/pull/62) for proper authentication cookie support.
